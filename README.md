# Java-practice-2

The first part of this project involves creating a class called OneItemBag, which demonstrates the use of generics, JavaDocs, and Java coding standards. This class is designed to function as a container that can store a single item of any type, determined at the time of creation, ensuring type safety and flexibility. The OneItemBag class provides three primary methods: addItem(), which adds an item to the bag and returns whether the addition was successful; removeItem(), which removes and returns the stored item or returns null if the bag is empty; and hasItem(), which checks if the bag currently contains an item, returning a boolean result. The project includes a demonstration class, BagUsageDemo, to test the functionality of the OneItemBag with different types of items, such as kiwis and acorns, without requiring modifications to the demo code. JavaDocs are required for proper documentation of each method, including descriptions of parameters, return values, and exceptions. Additionally, coding style is verified using Checkstyle, a tool that enforces adherence to style guidelines, ensuring proper indentation, naming conventions, and readability. A separate configuration checks JavaDoc formatting to promote professional code documentation practices. While JUnit tests are not provided, developers are encouraged to create their own test cases to verify correctness.

The second part of the project focuses on creating a program called BananaCoconut, which emphasizes command-line argument handling, exception management, and conditional output formatting. The program accepts a series of numbers as command-line arguments and processes them based on specific rules. Numbers that are multiples of 3 are replaced with “banana”, multiples of 7 are replaced with “coconut”, and multiples of both 3 and 7 are replaced with “banana-coconut”. Numbers smaller than 1 are replaced with “puttputt”, while valid numbers that do not meet any condition are printed as-is. The program also includes robust error handling to manage cases where arguments are missing or invalid, displaying an error message on System.err with usage instructions for the correct input format. To ensure the program produces output exactly as specified, a set of JUnit tests is provided in BananaCoconutTest.java, allowing developers to verify functionality across various cases, including edge conditions. Documentation using JavaDocs is required for all methods, explaining their behavior and expected inputs.
